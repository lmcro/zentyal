# Everything after a '#' character is ignored

# All whitespace is ignored

# Config keys are set this way:
#
# key = value
#
# They may contain comments at the end:
#
# key = value # this is ignored

# The amount of instances of SOGo that will be spawned
# to handle multiple requests simultaneously
#sogod_prefork=3

# If this key is set to yes, then when provisioning openchange
# all already existent directory elements will be ignored
# instead of raising an error.
# This applies to both schema elements and regular elelments.
# Remember that if the ignored elements have incompatible values
# this will result in a non working installation.
# The safer use for this is to resume a provision process which
# was interrupted when it was adding elements to the directory.
